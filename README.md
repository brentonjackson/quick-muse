Music player built during UGAHacks 2022 that plays loaded audio files in the browser
Initially, the goal was to make an online digital audio workstation app that allowed users to edit and create tracks online. During the day or so of working on it, we were able to upload and play different tracks, but a lot is left to be done.


## Tools
This is a React app that uses native HTML5 functionality for audio control


## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo.
2. Run `npm install` in terminal
3. Run `npm run start` in terminal and navigate to localhost:3000


## Future Work
I'd love to expand on this to make it more useful and open to diverging in several directions, most notably by converting it to a DJ app where a user and collaborators can add music from online sources, not only from local ones.

We are also very open to and love reading issues to improve any part of the app, as there is much room for improvement :).
